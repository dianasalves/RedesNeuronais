# ArtificialNeuronalNetworks


Part I

  With this project it was intended to elaborate a program that allows training a neural network (NR) of direct feeding in order to classify the logic-or-exclusive 
function considering two inputs and an additional input of bias (+1). A network with the topology (3x3x1) was used. Tests were made to observe the change in the Sum of 
Error Quadratic (SSE) for different initializations of NR weights.
  
Part II
 
 In the Data_multi.m file, an NR with the topology 3x5x3 was used, as a sigmoid activation function, a learning rate = 0.9, the weights initialized randomly in the 
interval [-1,1] and 10000 training epochs.
